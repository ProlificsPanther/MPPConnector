# MPP Connector

MPP stands for Manta-Prolifics-Purview Connector. It serves as an invaluable tool facilitating the seamless integration of MANTA's advanced lineage into existing Microsoft Purview solutions.

## Value Proposition

### What Does It Do:

Our connector empowers users to leverage Manta for the automatic collection of this lineage information, which can then be seamlessly integrated into Purview.

### Who Does it Help:

The MPP Connector is designed for Microsoft Purview customers seeking to enhance their data lineage capabilities beyond the standard scanning and ingestion features provided by Microsoft Purview.

It is especially beneficial for systems like SQL Server Integration Service (SSIS), IBM DataStage, Microsoft Power BI, SQL Server Analytics Service (SSAS) etc where data lineage is not automatically captured.
