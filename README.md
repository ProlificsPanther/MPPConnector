## Value Proposition

### What Does It Do:

Our connector empowers users to leverage Manta for the automatic collection of this lineage information, which can then be seamlessly integrated into Purview.

### Who Does it Help:

The MPP Connector is designed for Microsoft Purview customers seeking to enhance their data lineage capabilities beyond the standard scanning and ingestion features provided by Microsoft Purview.

It is especially beneficial for systems like SQL Server Integration Service (SSIS), IBM DataStage, Microsoft Power BI, SQL Server Analytics Service (SSAS) etc where data lineage is not automatically captured.

## Advantages of the Prolifics Manta Purview connector​

- Leverage Manta to scan and import metadata that is possible in Manta, but not possible in Purview such as ETL data integration tools like IBM Datastage and SSIS onprem
- Users can scan the metadata once with Manta, run integration to Purview, and get enriched data lineage views in Purview​
- Enrich Purview using metadata that was scanned by Manta and can provide breadth and depth to the lineage ​​
